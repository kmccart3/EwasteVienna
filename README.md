# EwasteVienna
A compilation of Ewaste collection material around die Angewandte in Vienna (1st district).


We hope this repository opens up a dialogue about how important it is to properly dispose of E-waste and also shares information on how to do that. All information shared here is free to use by anyone. We hope you can take this information and continue the discourse and information sharing. 

To find disposal sites near die Angewandte, check out this map.

And check out these two posters to learn more about E-waste. 

Feel free to spread and share the information!
